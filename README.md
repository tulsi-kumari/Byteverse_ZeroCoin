# Infrastructure Development Decentralized Application on Polygon

Welcome to the future of infrastructure development in India! This repository houses our groundbreaking Infrastructure Development Decentralized Application, powered by Hardhat, Ether.js, Next.js, and Solidity. We've harnessed the potential of blockchain technology, specifically the Polygon blockchain, to revolutionize the way infrastructure projects are managed and executed in India.

## Mission

Our mission is clear: to eradicate corruption, streamline paperwork, and bring unprecedented transparency to India's infrastructure development. With immutable smart contracts and a robust voting algorithm at the core of our system, we've created a tamper-proof, open-source solution that ensures swift progress and accountability.

## Key Features

- **Immutable Smart Contracts**: Our smart contracts, built using Solidity, are securely stored on the Polygon blockchain, making them resistant to tampering and corruption.

- **Robust Voting Algorithm**: We've implemented a transparent and efficient voting system that empowers stakeholders to make informed decisions, reducing the risk of foul play.

- **Streamlined Paperwork**: Say goodbye to cumbersome paperwork and bureaucracy. Our DApp automates documentation and record-keeping, saving time and resources.

- **Unprecedented Transparency**: Every transaction and decision made within our DApp is visible on the blockchain, ensuring complete transparency and accountability.

- **Swift Progress**: By eliminating bottlenecks and corruption, our DApp accelerates infrastructure development, leading to a more prosperous and sustainable India.

- **Open-Source Philosophy**: We believe in the power of collaboration. Our codebase is open-source, inviting developers and enthusiasts to contribute to the future of infrastructure development.

## Getting Started

To get started with our Infrastructure Development Decentralized Application, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Configure your Ethereum wallet and Polygon network settings and Metamask as well.
4. Make changes in the solidity file: Add engineer addresses from your metamask wallet in the constructor of our solidity file.
5. Next compile and deploy the contract using hardhat
```bash
npx hardhat compile
# or
npx hardhat scripts/deploy.js

```

6. Now run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```
7. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

Now you can start proposing contracts and approving them using multiple metamask accounts.
Be careful with the constraints put.
